    "Ans:1 Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that involves hiding the complex implementation details of a system while exposing only the necessary and relevant parts to the user. It allows developers to work with high-level concepts without needing to understand the intricate workings beneath the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points of Abstraction:\n",
    "- **Focus on Essentials:** It emphasizes the essential characteristics of an object or system that are relevant to the context.\n",
    "- **Simplifies Interaction:** By abstracting away the complexity, it simplifies interaction with objects and systems.\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Abstraction is closely related to encapsulation, which bundles data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a real-world example of a **Smartphone**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Abstraction Level:** When you use a smartphone, you interact with its user interface—icons, touch gestures, etc. You don’t need to know how the touchscreen works, how the phone's operating system manages resources, or how the hardware components communicate internally.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class Example:** In programming, you might create a `Smartphone` class that abstracts the complex details of a phone's functionality. Here’s a simple Python example to illustrate:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Smartphone:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "    def make_call(self, number):\n",
    "        # Abstracted implementation: Details of how the call is made are hidden\n",
    "        print(f\"Calling {number} from {self.brand} {self.model}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    def send_message(self, number, message):\n",
    "        # Abstracted implementation: Details of how the message is sent are hidden\n",
    "        print(f\"Sending message to {number}: {message}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the Smartphone class\n",
    "my_phone = Smartphone(\"BrandX\", \"ModelY\")\n",
    "my_phone.make_call(\"123-456-7890\")\n",
    "my_phone.send_message(\"123-456-7890\", \"Hello!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "- The `Smartphone` class abstracts the details of how calls and messages are actually processed.\n",
    "- The user of the `Smartphone` class only needs to know how to use the methods (`make_call` and `send_message`), not how they are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Abstraction:\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** Users can work with high-level objects without dealing with complex code.\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Changes in the implementation do not affect the interface, making the code easier to maintain and update.\n",
    "- **Reduced Complexity:** By focusing on the relevant aspects, the complexity of the codebase is reduced, leading to more readable and manageable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, abstraction allows you to design systems that are easier to work with by focusing on high-level operations while hiding low-level details."

    "\n",
    "### Abstraction\n",
    "* **Focuses on:** What the object does.\n",
    "* **Hides:** Implementation details.\n",
    "* **Provides:** A simplified view of the system.\n",
    "* **Example:** A car. You know how to drive it (accelerate, brake, steer), but you don't need to know how the engine works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Encapsulation\n",
    "* **Focuses on:** Protecting data and methods within a single unit.\n",
    "* **Hides:** Data implementation details.\n",
    "* **Provides:** Data integrity and security.\n",
    "* **Example:** A car. The engine, transmission, and other components are encapsulated within the car's body. You can't access or modify them directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: A Car Class\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Car {\n",
    "    private int speed; // Encapsulation: data hiding\n",
    "    private String color;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public void accelerate() { // Abstraction: providing a simplified interface\n",
    "        speed += 10;\n",

    "\n",
    "    public void brake() {\n",

    "        return speed;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example:\n",
    "* **Abstraction:** The `accelerate()` and `brake()` methods provide a simplified interface for interacting with the car's speed, without revealing how the speed is actually calculated or changed.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation:** The `speed` and `color` variables are private, protecting them from direct modification outside the class. The `getSpeed()` method provides controlled access to the `speed` value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences:**\n",
    "* Abstraction focuses on the external view of an object, while encapsulation focuses on the internal implementation.\n",
    "* Abstraction hides the complexity of the system, while encapsulation hides the data and methods within a class.\n",
    "* Abstraction is achieved through interfaces and abstract classes, while encapsulation is achieved through access modifiers (public, private, protected).\n",

    "Ans:3 The `abc` module in Python stands for \"Abstract Base Classes\" and provides a framework for defining abstract base classes. Abstract base classes (ABCs) are a way to define common interfaces for a group of related classes. They allow you to specify methods that must be implemented by any concrete (non-abstract) subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose of the `abc` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Enforcing Method Implementation:**\n",
    "   The primary use of `abc` is to define methods that must be implemented in derived classes. This ensures that any subclass adheres to a specific interface or contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining Common Interfaces:**\n",
    "   ABCs allow you to define a common interface for a group of classes, ensuring that they all provide specific methods and behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Facilitating Polymorphism:**\n",
    "   By defining abstract methods in a base class, you enable polymorphism, allowing objects of different classes to be treated through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components of the `abc` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`ABC` Class:**\n",
    "   - This is the base class from which all abstract base classes should inherit.\n",
    "   - It is used to create abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`abstractmethod` Decorator:**\n",
    "   - This decorator is used to declare methods as abstract, which means they must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`abstractproperty` Decorator (Deprecated):**\n",
    "   - This decorator was used for defining abstract properties, but it is deprecated in favor of `@property` and `@abstractmethod` combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how to use the `abc` module to create and use abstract base classes in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Shape(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Calculate the area of the shape.\"\"\"\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Calculate the perimeter of the shape.\"\"\"\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "        self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return 3.14 * (self.radius ** 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * 3.14 * self.radius\n",
    "\n",
    "class Rectangle(Shape):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width, height):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "\n",
    "    def perimeter(self):\n",
    "        return 2 * (self.width + self.height)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "shapes = [Circle(5), Rectangle(4, 6)]\n",
    "\n",
    "for shape in shapes:\n",
    "    print(f\"Area: {shape.area()}, Perimeter: {shape.perimeter()}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining the Abstract Base Class:**\n",
    "   - `Shape` is an abstract base class derived from `ABC`.\n",
    "   - It has two abstract methods: `area()` and `perimeter()`. These methods must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implementing Concrete Classes:**\n",
    "   - `Circle` and `Rectangle` are concrete classes that inherit from `Shape`.\n",
    "   - They provide implementations for the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using the Abstract Base Class:**\n",
    "   - Instances of `Circle` and `Rectangle` can be used polymorphically, as they all adhere to the `Shape` interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using the `abc` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contract Enforcement:** Ensures that subclasses provide specific methods, promoting consistent interfaces across different classes.\n",
    "- **Code Clarity:** Makes it clear which methods are expected to be implemented, aiding in code readability and maintainability.\n",
    "- **Design Flexibility:** Encourages designing with interfaces in mind, allowing for flexible and interchangeable components.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module is a powerful tool for creating robust and maintainable object-oriented designs in Python by enforcing a clear and consistent contract across related classes."

    "Ans:4 ## Achieving Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Data abstraction is the process of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. This is achieved primarily through two mechanisms in object-oriented programming:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Abstract Classes\n",
    "* **Partial Abstraction:** Abstract classes can contain both abstract methods (without implementation) and concrete methods (with implementation).\n",
    "* **Inheritance:** Subclasses inherit the abstract class and provide implementations for the abstract methods.\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "abstract class Shape {\n",
    "    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method\n",
    "    void fillColor(String color) { // Concrete method\n",
    "        // Implementation for filling color\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Interfaces\n",
    "* **Complete Abstraction:** Interfaces contain only abstract methods.\n",
    "* **Multiple Inheritance:** A class can implement multiple interfaces.\n",
    "* **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "interface Drawable {\n",
    "    void draw();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key points to remember:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Focus on behavior:** Both abstract classes and interfaces define the behavior of an object without revealing its implementation details.\n",
    "* **Hide complexity:** By exposing only essential methods, abstraction simplifies the interaction with an object.\n",
    "* **Increase reusability:** Abstract classes and interfaces promote code reusability through inheritance and implementation.\n",
    "* **Improve maintainability:** Changes to the implementation details can be made without affecting the code that uses the abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a `Car` class. We can use abstraction to hide the complex internal workings of the car and expose only the essential methods like `start()`, `stop()`, `accelerate()`, etc. This allows a driver to use the car without knowing the details of the engine, transmission, or other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "By effectively using abstract classes and interfaces, you can create well-structured, maintainable, and reusable code. \n",

    "Ans: 5 ## No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An abstract class is a blueprint for other classes.** It's designed to provide a common structure and behavior for its subclasses, but it's not complete on its own. It often contains abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why can't we create an instance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Incomplete definition:** An abstract class lacks a full implementation. Creating an instance would mean creating an object with incomplete behavior.\n",
    "* **Purpose of abstraction:** Abstract classes are meant to be extended and specialized by subclasses. Creating an instance would defeat the purpose of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "abstract class Shape {\n",
    "    abstract void draw(); // Abstract method\n",
    "}\n",

    "In this example, `Shape` is an abstract class. You cannot create an object of type `Shape` because it doesn't provide a concrete implementation for the `draw()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To create an object, you need a concrete class that extends the abstract class and provides implementations for all abstract methods:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "class Circle extends Shape {\n",
    "    void draw() {\n",
    "        // Implementation for drawing a circle\n",

    "Circle circle = new Circle();\n",
    "circle.draw();\n",
    "```\n",
